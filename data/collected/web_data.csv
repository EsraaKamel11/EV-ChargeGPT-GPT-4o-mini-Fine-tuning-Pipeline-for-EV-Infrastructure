California Consumer Privacy Notice If you are a California resident, California law provides you (also occasionally referred to in this section as “consumer”) with additional rights, as described below regarding our use of your Personal Information. Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”): Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84 (known as the “Shine the Light” law), California residents are entitled to ask us annually for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information (if any) which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties with whom we have shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. You also have the right to request that we revise your Personal Information on record.

How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals: California law (CalOPPA) requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. We do not allow personalized third-party behavioral tracking, though we may use De-Identified Personal Information to track users’ click or browsing patterns.

This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. Right of Access to Specific Information You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Data Access and Deletion Rights), we will disclose to you: The categories of personal information we collected about you. The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you. Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information. The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information. The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you. Deletion Request Rights You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Data Access and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. Deletion of your personal information means you are no longer an EVgo customer and no longer able to receive any Services. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.). Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us. Comply with a legal obligation. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. We may opt to delete that portion of your information which comprises personal information (as defined under CCPA), and retain the remainder of your information that does not comprise personal information. Exercising Data Access and Deletion Rights. To exercise the data access and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us either by completing the webform at our Website page here, or calling us at 877-324-0099. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for data access twice within a 12-month period. Verification Process WEBFORM VERIFICATION METHOD: When you submit a request using our webform (available here) we will match the information you submitted with the information we have for you on file. Upon verification of your identity we will proceed to process your request (subject to the exceptions stated above). EMAIL VERIFICATION METHOD: Upon receiving a data access or deletion request from you we will send an email to you at the email address we have for you on file. The email will ask you to respond to verify you as the Consumer making the request. Upon receipt of your verification we will match your information to that which is in our file. Upon verification of your identity we will proceed to process your request (subject to the exceptions stated above). The verifiable consumer request must: (1) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, and (2) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Response Timing and Format We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we email our response to the email address for that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data access requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically, in PDF format. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: Deny you goods or services. Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.

Renewable Energy & Sustainability | Electrify America,"Renewable Energy & Sustainability Now Backed by 100% Renewable Energy One of Electrify America’s primary goals is to support Zero-Emission Vehicle adoption in the United States, but we’re not stopping there. Electrify America is committed to a net zero carbon footprint for all energy delivered to drivers. Today, when you charge with us, the energy delivered from our network is backed by 100% renewable energy from Electrify America Solar Glow™ 1 and other renewable energy certificates. Our Focus on Additionality Electrify America Solar Glow™ 1: Our First Solar Farm With over 200,000 solar panels, our first solar farm in Southern California generates an estimated 75 megawatts at peak capacity and produced 225 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy in its first year. This is an important milestone in our commitment to reduce our energy carbon footprint, improve efficiency, and elevate the customer experience. LEARN MORE Types of Solar Charging Stations and Features 100% Solar-Powered Level 2 Stations Electrify America has invested $2 million in 30 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across rural California. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations aren’t tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Equipped with a sun-tracking solar array and energy storage, each station can charge two vehicles simultaneously, rain or shine. Capable vehicles can charge at speeds up to 3.5 kW. On-Site Solar Canopies Stay cool while you charge at locations like our Baker, California station, where solar canopies provide shade and deliver energy back to the grid. These charging stations integrate with the local electrical grid and some even feature on-site energy storage, delivering efficient, reliable charging. Building a Grid-Friendly Charging Network Charging multiple EVs at the same station requires lots of power. To ease electrical grid demand during peak use times, we've installed 150+ Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) at select locations.

Blink Charging Sustainability Efforts,"ABOUT US Sustainability We are on a mission to help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and the harmful emissions they produce. Blink Charging is committed to sustainability and reducing the carbon footprint of transportation. As a leading provider of EV charging equipment and services, we recognize the vital role that EVs play in the transition to a cleaner and more sustainable future. Our mission is to accelerate EV adoption by providing reliable, affordable, and convenient charging solutions that empower drivers to make the switch to electric. We believe that by making EV charging accessible and convenient, we can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels and the harmful emissions they produce. In addition to providing EV charging solutions, we also prioritize sustainability in our own operations. We are committed to reducing our environmental impact by minimizing waste, conserving resources, and using sustainable materials whenever possible. Environmental, Social & Governance We acknowledge that responsible business conduct is crucial for sustained success and, through our Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Committee’s efforts, aim to make meaningful contributions to society and the environment whilst delivering value to our stakeholders and customers. Serving as a liaison with the ESG Committee, our appointed Director of Sustainability plays a crucial role in overseeing our sustainability initiatives; ensuring the integration of sustainable practices into our corporate strategy, identifying risk and improvement areas, and facilitating communication and reporting on our sustainability progress. In February 2024, Blink strengthened its integral focus on sustainable growth by creating a new Global ESG Program Manager role to lead an international team alongside the Director of Sustainability. Steering our organization towards a more sustainable future, the ESG Program aligns effectively with Blink’s mission and goals. This program-driven team simultaneously adopted the Blink Europe groups’ Environmental Impact Working Group and Blink UK’s Social Value Delivery Programme. As leaders in the industry, we are committed to this endeavor, with transparency and accountability, and we are submitting to an ESG corporate rating to further enhance our performance efficacy and propel us towards continuous improvement. 10K link - All SEC Filings :: Blink Charging Co. (BLNK) Highlights LEED Gold Standard Green Buildings Two of our major offices – our HQ in Bowie, USA and Noida, India – are LEED Gold standard Green Buildings. ISO 9001 Certified Both of our manufacturing facilities hold ISO 9001:2015 – Quality Management. EcoVadis Sustainability Blink attained its Committed badge with EcoVadis Sustainability Rating. Planet Mark Certification Blink’s European operations (Belgium, Netherlands, UK & Ireland) attained its Planet Mark Business Certification, assessed carbon footprint. International Green Hall of Fame Blink is honored to be the first EV charging infrastructure company to be inducted into the International Green Hall of Fame. Blink's EV Fleet Blink now operates a 100% EV-fleet in Belgium and UK. *Data from January – December 2024 ESG PILLARS Environmental We are committed to implementing sustainable practices across our operations. By prioritizing environmental responsibility, we aim to contribute to a more sustainable future for our planet and society. Focus: reducing carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and minimizing waste. ESG PILLARS Social By prioritizing social responsibility, we aim to create value for our stakeholders while also contributing to a more just and equitable society. Focus: protecting human rights, preventing discrimination, ensuring the well-being of our communities, and ethical supply management. ESG PILLARS Governance We strive for accountability, transparency, and integrity across our operations to build long-term value for stakeholders and foster trust with customers, partners, and the community. Focus: board oversight & governance, fair compensation, corruption prevention, and maintenance of ethical standards. Our Sustainable Commitment In Action We believe that sustainability is more than a buzzword - it's a way of life. We are committed to doing our part to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for generations to come. Here are a few ways we are bringing that commitment to life. Accessible Charging We've built one of the world's largest and most dependable EV charging networks, boasting over 85,000 charging ports, including numerous networked stations worldwide. Our extensive network simplifies EV charging, facilitating the transition to electric vehicles and minimizing carbon emissions. Renewable Energy Blink is on a mission to support a clean energy transition, including our own power. 45% of our leased premises globally are powered by a renewable energy supply – we continue to work with landlords in all our locations to implement increasingly sustainable facilities solutions. In the UK and Netherlands, where Blink powers the charger, it has always been 100% renewable. Across our entire European network, nearly 25% of drawn power is from a verified renewable supply. Reducing Emissions We are working to reduce emissions from our own business operations and have assessed our scope 1, 2 and a subset of scope 3 emissions, in line with the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Kyoto) Protocol. Blink Europe’s Baseline Year (2023) carbon emissions were calculated at 279.5tCO2e (location-based). Reducing E-Waste We recognize the importance of minimizing electronic waste and ensuring the proper disposal of outdated charging equipment. On the European continent, 91% of the components of our retired units are recycled through partner Out of Use. Recycling Initiatives Our office and manufacturing facilities all separate recyclables from refuse for collection and teams opt for reusable items where possible. In 2025, our UK offices have joined our Belgian, Dutch and Indian teams in also separating food waste for composting. We use TerraCycle ZeroWaste boxes for ‘hard-to-recycle' consumables packaging. Valuing Well-Being With health insurance packages, employee assistance programs, payment of living wages and trained Mental Health First Aiders among our colleagues, we are committed to valuing our peoples’ well-being, alongside compelling benefits and an evolving engagement and satisfaction program. Product Impact We are mindful of the health impact of our production processes on our workers and the environment. As such, all employees are equipped with appropriate PPE. We submit annual reports to the Pollution Control Board detailing hazardous waste and chemicals handling and undertake regular testing against particulate matter, acid mist and NOx protocols. We operate a closed-loop system to collect and safely dispose of paint dust and particles. Fleet Electrification We understand the barriers and pain-points to EV adoption and lasting changes to travel habits. We are on our own fleet electrification journey, learning alongside our clients. In 2024, our European fleet became fully electric, as Belgium switched its last remaining hybrid car for a BEV. 82% of our global facilities have on-site charging provisions. Social Impact Positive social impact has become part of the Blink fabric, with various initiatives for our employees to give back to the community and support environmentally conscious projects. Our US-based ‘Green Team’ has participated in numerous volunteer clean-up efforts in and around Miami Beach and Bowie rivers, including trash collection. Our sister companies around the globe already had existing efforts and ideas in place, and our globalization has allowed us to expand impact, inspire one another, and further connect across our internal working relationships and with communities and initiatives local to colleagues on each continent. In 2025, Blink celebrated Earth Day by getting our hands in the soil – from planting trees in Bangalore and Noida, India to litter-picking local parkland in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to conserving woodland in Hertfordshire, UK. People & Culture Blink Charging is committed to fostering a workplace where people are at the heart of everything we do. We believe a strong, positive culture drives innovation, excellence, and collaboration across our business. Creating an environment where people feel valued and respected ensures that all employees can thrive, contribute, and share their ideas freely. Our commitment to building a supportive culture is reflected in our broader sustainability and governance efforts. We provide ongoing training and development to empower all employees, ensure fair treatment, and offer equal opportunities for growth and advancement. We also value a diverse and talented workforce across all levels, from entry-level roles to executive management and the Board of Directors. Green Building Certification Blink proudly celebrated the grand opening of our new LEED Gold-certified 30,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Bowie, Maryland, in March 2024, Our Bowie facility joins our Noida, India premises which was awarded LEED Gold certification in 2019. LEED, administered by the U.S. Green Building Council, is a globally recognized rating system aimed at assessing the environment and health impacts of building construction operations. Our commitment to meeting LEED Gold certification standards underscores Blink’s dedication to leadership in sustainability within the EV industry. Corporate Social Responsibility Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) falls under the broad umbrella of sustainability. CSR is a commitment by businesses to act ethically, contribute to economic development, and improve the quality of life for their employees, local communities, and society as a whole. Many definitions emphasize the delivery of financial, environmental, and social benefits to a broad range of stakeholders, suggesting voluntary actions that go beyond legal requirements. There is significant overlap and interplay between ESG and CSR concepts. Blink Charging has elected to address both ESG and CSR concerns through the oversight of its Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and ESG Policy. All Blink employees undertake anti-bribery and corruption training during induction and through annual updates. Blink's General Counsel and Executive Vice President of Mergers & Acquisitions oversees Blink’s ABC program. Although climate change and environmental concerns continue to receive significant attention, there has been a growing emphasis on addressing social issues, with a particular focus on the well-being of employees and the implementation of effective human capital management policies. We believe CSR is a critical aspect of our overall sustainability and ESG strategy. Blink Charging’s executive management and ESG Committee are responsible for the oversight, monitoring, and regular reporting of the Company’s CSR metrics. The ESG and Nominating committee is responsible overall for Sustainability, including that of Occupational Health and Safety, cyber security and Anti-bribery & corruption (ABC) practices. The committee is chaired by an executive board member and reports directly to the Board. Conflict Minerals 2025 Europe Carbon Reduction Plan Planet Mark Business Certification Ethical Procurement Blink Charging has adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”) is applicable to both the Company and our suppliers and mirrors our commitment to ethical business practices, including labor rights, environmental responsibility, health and safety, and ethical sourcing. By implementing this Code of Conduct, we are holding ourselves and our suppliers to the highest standards of accountability and sustainability. We believe that responsible business practices are not only the right thing to do, but also critical to the long-term success and well-being of our Company, our suppliers, and the communities in which we operate. Blink Charging expects its suppliers to be in compliance with the Code of Conduct. View Supplier Code of Conduct International Standards and Integrated Management Systems Blink operates Integrated Management Systems in its Indian and UK operations (comprising 55% of our global facilities), with ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health & Safety, 9001:2015 Quality Management System, 14001:2015 Environmental Management System certifications.

How to Answer Top EV FAQs This Season at Your Dealership | Blink Charging Blog,"How to Answer Top EV FAQs This Season at Your Dealership Posted 05/09/2023 It's a new car-buying season and many new car buyers want to take advantage of the federal government’s electric vehicle tax incentives. With many customers considering their first EV, it's up to the dealership sales representatives to answer questions and address knowledge gaps about this new technology. To help, we have compiled some of the most common frequently asked questions asked by dealership customers and new EV owners before buying their first EV. What is the difference between Level 1, Level 2, and Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations? Before we begin, it should be noted that the term “charger” is a bit unique when talking about EVs. Each EV comes with an on-board charger inside the vehicle. Level 1 and Level 2 charging stations simply provide alternating current (AC) electricity to the vehicle’s on-board charger, which then converts AC to direct current (DC) electricity and charges the battery. The on-board charger is different from an external EV charging station, also referred to as EV Supply Equipment or EVSE. In most cases, the word ""charger"" refers to a charging station or cable that delivers power to the vehicle. Level 1 chargers These are the charging cables that come with most EVs. They are small enough to carry in a vehicle truck and plug into a regular 120 volt wall outlet. Generally speaking, they will take 12+ hours to fully charge an EV. (It could be several dozen hours if they are charging a battery from empty.) Level 2 chargers These are the next step up in charging equipment. For a faster home charging experience, EV drivers can purchase Level 2 chargers such as the Blink HQ 150 or HQ 200. In addition, most commercial public, multi-unit, and workplace charging stations will be Level 2 chargers. Depending on the model, Level 2 charging stations provide up to 80amp to fully charge an EV in 4-8 hours, though some vehicles may take longer. Level 2 chargers can either plug into a 240 volt electrical outlet, or they can be directly wired into an existing electrical system. Multi-unit and public chargers will virtually always be hardwired into an electrical system. As seen in the graphic above, AC Level 1 and Level 2 charging stations send AC power to the onboard charger, which then converts to DC power to charge the battery. DC fast chargers (DCFC) Unlike Level 1 and Level 2 chargers, DC fast chargers can charge a vehicle in under an hour. That's because DCFC transfers DC power directly from the energy grid into the vehicle battery, bypassing the onboard charger. DC fast chargers provide 100 to 500 amps of power to battery electric vehicles. Due to the installation and electrical costs, most DCFC are installed for commercial fleets, near highways, and at other public parking facilities. How long will it take to charge my EV? It depends. Factors that affect the amount of time it takes to charge a vehicle include: The type of charging station used (L1, L2, DCFC). How powerful the vehicle’s onboard charger is. How full/empty the vehicle’s battery is at plug-in. How much power the vehicle’s onboard charger is capable of receiving. According to the US Department of Transportation (DOT), using vehicle that has a 60-kWh battery, a Level 1 charger can take up to 40-50 hours for a full charge, a Level 2 charger can take 4-10 hours, and a DCFC can fill a battery to 80% in 20 minutes to an hour. While many drivers expect to charge to 100%, regenerative braking features can send power from the wheels back to the battery. Note that for DCFCs, the DOT says: “Charging speed slows as the battery gets closer to full to prevent damage to the battery. Therefore, it is more cost- and time-efficient for EV drivers to use direct current fast charging until the battery reaches 80 percent, and then continue on their trip. It can take about as long to charge the last 10 percent of an EV battery as the first 90 percent.” When talking to your car buyers, it's important to mention that 80% of charging will be done at home, and many workplaces are now installing commercial chargers as an employee amenity. How do I find a charger? Finding a charger is relatively easy. Chargers will obviously be easier to locate in urban areas. Drivers can use a service such as: Google Maps Apple Maps Their vehicle’s navigation system (if available) The Blink app for iOS and the Blink Android app The PlugShare website or the PlugShare app for iOS or the PlugShare Android app Most drivers, when using a networked public or home charging station will use an app for charging. Some new drivers may find a demonstration helpful on how to locate a charger using these popular charging apps. Can my Tesla use non-Tesla charging stations? Yes, but Tesla drivers must use an adapter. Can I use a DCFC? No, if you have a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Yes, if you have a battery electric vehicle (BEV). In order to use a DCFC, you will need to make sure you have the matching charging port. While there is a standard plug for Level 1 and Level 2 charging, there are multiple charging standards for DCFC. The DOT says this about the different charging port types: “Different vehicles have different charge ports. For DCFC, the Combined Charging System (CCS) connector is based on an open international standard and is common on vehicles manufactured in North America and Europe; the CHArge de Move (CHAdeMO) connector is most common for Japanese manufactured vehicles. Tesla vehicles have a unique connector that works for all charging speeds, including at Tesla’s “Supercharger” DCFC stations, while non-Tesla vehicles require adapters at these stations.” How much will it cost to charge my EV? It depends. This is because pricing varies by location and by who owns the charger. Many public chargers are owned by the property host, not the station manufacturer/network provider. For example, Blink charging stations are often owned by the site host, who is responsible for setting the price for the power. Due to Blink's flexibility, some site hosts can also participate in other business models where Blink sets pricing. That price can depend on factors such as how much a site host pays for electricity, local utility sourcing, time of day, availability of specialty pricing for certain groups (such as employees or residents), and how many other chargers are located nearby. Generally, you will see three different types of pricing: Free Price per kilowatt hour based on how much power you consume Price per hour based on how much time you spend charging Regardless of the type of pricing, you should be able to see the price on the station’s screen or in the locator app. Conclusion There are bound to be many questions about EVs for your automotive dealership salespeople from new-to-EV customers. With a little preparedness, your sales team will be able to help these new customers get into the perfect EV to suit their needs. With the federal used and commercial EV tax credits now eligible for residents’ 2023 taxes, even those who want to buy a used vehicle can purchase their first EV! Now is the time for automotive dealership salespeople to familiarize themselves with EV terminology and get comfortable answering all the questions that are bound to come their way.

The Benefits of EVs and Why They’re Here to Stay | Blink Charging Blog,"The Benefits of EVs and Why They’re Here to Stay Posted 08/23/2023 The market is here, the market is now and it’s electric. The electric vehicle (EV) industry has not only experienced exponential growth in the past decade but has also yielded remarkable economic benefits. Giving rise to an entire culture, EVs have surpassed mere trends and evolved into a comprehensive lifestyle that prioritizes a sustainable future. Whether you're an experienced EV enthusiast or new to the scene, a multitude of innovative EV solutions awaits your exploration. While there is a world of advantages, here are three reasons why EVs are here to stay. Cut Costs, Time, and Effort with EVs Cost competitiveness, heightened convenience, and streamlined maintenance, accompanied by amplified fuel savings – these are the undeniable benefits awaiting those who make the decision to invest in EVs. EVs Help You Save Many people ask whether electric cars are worth it due to the upfront expense. However, when you factor in federal tax incentives, electric cars actually end up costing about the same as regular cars. And here's the cool part: electric cars need less maintenance and are cheaper to power, so you save money over the life of the vehicle. Government policies are giving a big boost to EV adoption. The Inflation Reduction Act expanded the previous EV tax credit to lower costs for qualified buyers. These credits offer up to $7,500 for new vehicles, up to $4,000 for used EVs, and even up to 30% for commercial vehicles and buses. And the good news doesn't stop there – the support for EV charging infrastructure at businesses will continue until 2032, with the maximum tax credit raised from $30,000 to $100,000. This all adds up to more electric vehicles on the road, more savings for drivers, and a healthier environment. But it’s not just about initial costs. Electric cars also save you money on fuel. EV drivers have the potential to reduce fuel expenses by up to $14,500 over a 15-year period of owning an electric car. This translates to nearly $1,000 saved annually throughout the driving experience. And thanks to their technology, they can go hundreds of miles without needing more power, making them reliable for commuting, running your daily errands or even road trips. And thanks to the NEVI Program and national expansion of DC fast chargers, owning an EV is even more accessible in all parts of the United States. Convenient EV Charging Electric cars also make life easier. The number of EV charging ports and station locations has been consistently on the rise. Between 2015 and 2020, EV charging ports more than doubled. In just 2021, the International Energy Agency writes that they grew by over 55%. Blink is helping to lead this initiative by facilitating the worldwide transition to EVs with our user-friendly L2 chargers and extensive charging station infrastructure. EV owners can find our L2 chargers at convenient locations that they frequent everyday such as parks, grocery stores, and parking lots, making it simple to charge on the go and not have to worry about going out of your way simply to charge your EV. And guess what? You can even charge your electric car at home. With over 80% of EV drivers choosing this method, Blink offers the HQ 200 charger, designed to simplify your home charging experience. We offer a multitude of charging options for single-family and multifamily residential charging, ensuring that charging your EV is the least of your worries. Electric cars aren't just beneficial for your finances; they also bring remarkable convenience to your ownership experience. The EV Network The EV market is booming. In 2022 alone, a whopping 10 million EVs were sold, showing how people are choosing greener transportation as their primary source of transportation. Considering all the real advantages we've talked about, such as government support and more charging stations, there's one more reason why EVs are here to stay: the strong EV community. EVs have become more than just cars, they're a movement. People and communities are adopting sustainable transport, creating an eco-friendly mindset. Big car companies are also jumping on board, making better batteries and more efficient EVs. In 2020, the SUV segment experienced the most extensive diversification of models and witnessed significant growth. SUVs and pick-ups accounted for over 55% of the total newly announced vehicle models globally. Prominent car manufacturers are actively adopting EV technology, pushing forward improvements in battery efficiency, extended driving ranges, and overall performance standards. This dedicated and strategic engagement plays a crucial role in shaping the direction of the automotive industry. This commitment is shaping the future of cars, offering a variety of impressive EV models for smart consumers. The EV culture is here to stay too. There are EV car sharing, EV chat groups, EV car shows, all showcasing a community of growing eco-mobility drivers that have enthusiastically adopted and endorsed sustainable transportation practices. This shift in thinking extends beyond simple vehicle choices, contributing to the development of a societal understanding profoundly anchored in environmentally friendly transportation. Benefits to Economy Finally, EVs contribute significantly to the economy. They slash fuel costs and pivot spending from imported oil to local electricity sources. This saved money gets pumped back into the local economy, generating more jobs. An electric car can save about $1,000 in fuel yearly. Duke Energy calculates that charging a 60 kWh EV with over 230 miles range at home costs less than $8. Plus, energy prices are steadier than oil, making EV budgeting more consistent. This year, global electric car sales are predicted to reach a new all-time high, making up almost one-fifth of all car sales. This remarkable growth is reshaping the car industry and has important implications for the energy sector, particularly oil. According to the IEA's annual Global Electric Vehicle Outlook, over 10 million electric cars were bought worldwide in 2022. Sales are anticipated to rise by 35% this year, hitting 14 million. This rapid expansion means that electric cars' portion of total car sales has grown from about 4% in 2020 to 14% in 2022. It's expected to further increase to 18% this year, according to the latest projections from IEA. Blink Expands to Charge More EVs At Blink, we've seen firsthand how the EV industry is growing (and thriving). Our recent performance has been exceptional, with our highest earnings quarter to date.

Meeting Residential and Workplace Growth Goals with EV Charging | Blink Charging Blog,"Meeting Residential and Workplace Growth Goals with EV Charging Posted 02/29/2024 Whether you own a business, a commercial property, or a multifamily housing complex, you likely have growth goals to meet for the year. Every owner or investor strives to maximize their profit or return on investment for their properties. Fortunately, there’s a relatively simple way to help increase the money coming into your multifamily or workplace investment property: install electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Here's what you need to know. How EVSE makes your investment property better Electric vehicle (EV) chargers are an amenity that instantly raises the value of any multifamily, residential, or commercial property. According to a study published in Nature Sustainability last year, single-family homes located within one kilometer (0.6 miles) of public EV charging infrastructure experienced a 3.3% (or US $17,212) rise in property value compared to homes without nearby chargers. Homes with EV chargers within 400 to 500 meters (437 to 547 yards) saw an even higher increase of 5.8% in property value. Additionally, the study revealed that neighborhoods with public EV chargers also experienced lower levels of particulate matter emissions by 1.3 – 2.2% compared to those without any chargers. While the Nature Sustainability study focused on single-family homes, it’s evident that EVSE has a positive impact both economically and environmentally for properties. Preparing your investment for future needs While having EVSE at home or work is still currently considered a luxury, within the next decade, it will essentially become mandatory. Many municipalities are already incorporating EV charger installation requirements into their building codes to ensure that new buildings are equipped for the increasing number of EV drivers. Installing EVSE in your multifamily community enables you to cater to families who either already own an EV or are planning to purchase one soon. It also helps attract businesses to your commercial property that may wish to specifically target EV owners. This is significant because EVs are rapidly becoming the norm in the United States and worldwide. The worldwide EV market is projected to surpass $632 billion this year and maintain a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10% between 2024 and 2028. This growth trajectory indicates that the market is expected to exceed $906 billion by then, with over 17 million EVs sold globally. With the anticipated surge in EV sales and usage in the U.S., renters and condo dwellers will seek places where they can reliably charge their vehicles at home, as approximately 80% of EV charging occurs there. By installing EVSE at your multifamily residence, you assure EV owners that they will have the convenience of charging their vehicles reliably. Considering that the average EV owner tends to have a higher income compared to the general public, installing EVSE will help your multifamily residence (and any businesses in your commercial properties) attract higher incomes individuals and the crucial disposable income that accompanies it. Support green initiatives There’s no question that EVSE contributes to achieving your sustainability objectives, especially if you’re pursuing Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) points for your multifamily or commercial property. EV chargers offer a simple way to earn a point towards your property's goals. Through the Blink Network, you can generate environmental reports illustrating the CO2 emissions prevented by your chargers, as well as the amount of oil saved and gallons of fuel saved from being converted into greenhouse gas emissions. What kind of chargers should you install in a multifamily residence? It’s evident that installing EVSE in your multifamily residence yields benefits such as increased property value, attracting higher-income clients and customers, future investment preparation, and decreased greenhouse gas emissions. However, to fully maximize the advantages of electric vehicle charger installation, it’s crucial to consider the type of charger suitable for a multifamily residence or commercial property. For multifamily residences and commercial properties with businesses where customers will spend a significant amount of time, it’s recommended to install Level 2 (L2) EV chargers, such as the Blink Series 8 Commercial Level 2 EV Charging Station.

How EVs and EV Charging Can Help Corporate Scope 3 Emissions Goals | Blink Charging Blog,"How EVs and EV Charging Can Help Corporate Scope 3 Emissions Goals Posted 09/19/2023 Every business is searching for ways to cut down on their greenhouse gas emissions, and that includes your customers and your suppliers. The corporate value chain links companies together, and if a company wants to truly reduce its carbon footprint, that means it must consider not only its own direct greenhouse gas emissions, but also how to reduce the emissions from its upstream and downstream positions. Transitioning corporate vehicle fleets from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is a concrete step toward reducing emissions and helping every company in a given value chain, along with providing EV charging for your employees. Here’s what you need to know about how to use EV charging to reduce your company’s direct and indirect emissions. What Are the Three Types of Greenhouse Gas Emission Sources? The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol has identified three different categories of corporate greenhouse gas emissions throughout the value chain. With the Scope 3 Standard, companies can now measure and report upstream and downstream emissions, not just those directly controlled by corporate activities. This standard allows improves transparency and allows companies to develop more effective strategies for emissions reductions. Here is how the GHG Protocol describes the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Scope 1 Emissions Scope 1 emissions are generated by operations that are directly owned or controlled by the company. These emissions might include company-owned equipment or company-owned fleet vehicles. Scope 2 Emissions Scope 2 emissions include upstream emissions from generating electricity bought by the company. An example would be if a company uses electricity from a coal-burning power plant. The company would be indirectly responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the power it uses. Scope 3 Emissions Scope 3 emissions present the greatest opportunity for companies and organizations and represent all indirect emissions that are not included in Scope 2. These emissions are neither produced by the company itself nor the result of activities from assets owned or controlled by the company. Upstream emissions may be related to goods and services acquired by the company, and downstream emissions may be related to goods and services sold to a customer. Scope 3 emissions include any products and services that a company buys, uses and disposes of from suppliers. As an example, if your company purchases pallets from another company, your company is indirectly responsible for the emissions produced during the creation and shipping process of the pallets. Other examples include business travel, employee commutes, leased assets, and transportation of your products via a third-party to your customer. How EVs and EV Charging Can Help Reduce Scope 3 Emissions Scope 1 emissions are easiest to define because they are directly within your business’s control. When you use EVs in your company-owned fleet, you are helping to reduce your company’s Scope 1 emissions because your fleet is an asset of your company. Similarly, using renewable energy sources for charging your EV fleet can help reduce your Scope 2 emissions because, unlike internal combustion engine vehicles, there are no emissions associated with generating the “fuel” consumed by your fleet. Purchasing green energy or adding solar panels to your property can reduce the amount of carbon-emitting energy used on your property. But not only can fleet electrification benefit your own fleet operational costs and Scope 1 emissions, but it can also be used as a selling point to your own customers. Whether your company is in the shipping business or simply uses a corporate fleet, your company can help other companies in your supply chain reduce their Scope 3 emissions. By choosing your company versus a competitor, your customers can know that your products and services offer less indirect greenhouse gas emissions due to your zero-emissions fleet. EV benefits beyond fleets While having an EV fleet and buying renewable energy obviously helps reduce your company’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, installing electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) for employees at your workplace helps to further reduce your Scope 3 indirect emissions and your business partners’ indirect emissions. Employee commuting is considered part of your business’s Scope 3 emissions, because employees are traveling to work using personal (or public) transportation. While they are relevant to the company, they are not controlled directly by company processes. This means that by encouraging electric vehicle use among employees, your business can reduce its upstream Scope 3 emissions. Fewer employees driving ICE vehicles means fewer emissions polluting the environment. This translates to fewer Scope 3 emissions for your business partners and customers who are buying products and services from your company. Installing EV charging infrastructure and encouraging your employees to switch to EVs reduces Scope 3 emissions across your supply chain. By installing EV chargers at your business, you can encourage them to make the transition to EVs. Most EV charging takes place at home and at places where a vehicle would be parked for a significant amount of time, like at work. Provide employees with a way to charge their vehicles at work and they will be more likely to switch to an EV when they are ready to purchase or lease their next vehicle. Why Reducing Scope 3 Emissions Matters Regardless of which category they fall under, reducing emissions is good for the environment and good for the health of everyone who works for and with your business. But there are also concrete economic benefits. In addition to consumers – especially younger, Gen Z consumers – who are choosing to support businesses that are more environmentally conscious, businesses also want to work with other companies that make efforts to be more sustainable. A Harvard Business Review study found that multinational companies are increasingly pledging to only procure the materials and services they need from businesses with fair labor practices and environmental protections in place. Boosting your corporate sustainability and taking steps to reduce your corporate emissions makes your company more attractive to other businesses that want to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. How to Get Started with Electric Vehicle Charging at Businesses When you make the decision to go electric, the first step is choosing the right electrification partner who will help you determine your needs, assess your site, and walk you through the process of procuring any outside funding you may be eligible for. Once all that is completed, your installation can begin, which may involve some electrical upgrades to your site. Which are the best EV chargers to choose for fleets and employee parking? Each business has unique needs, but generally, Level 2 chargers will be the main type of charger you will need for fleets and employee parking. Level 2 EV chargers, like the Blink Series 7, are ideal for charging up a depot and can charge a vehicle in four to eight hours depending on different factors. If your business offers take-home fleet vehicles to employees, you can also offer a smart networked Level 2 home charger like the Blink HQ 200 to ensure that each driver can charge their EV at home. Conclusion When you install EV charging equipment for your fleet vehicles and employee parking, you are not only helping your company reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, you are helping every single company up and down your supply chain reduce their Scope 3 emissions. As more businesses are looking for partners who engage in sustainable practices, the benefits of emission reduction are both environmental and economical.

"How EV Charging Building Codes Help ""Future-Proof"" New Developments","How EV Make Ready Building Codes Help ""Future-Proof"" New Developments Posted 02/14/2023 It's not just vehicles that are changing with the shift to electricity. The buildings we inhabit, and their parking lots, are evolving too. More and more municipalities are adopting new building codes that mandate electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in new developments, further facilitating the overall adoption of EVs. Here's what you need to know about EV building codes, also known as EV Make Ready infrastructure. Why building codes are important Building codes are important for standardizing building quality and safety. For example, before the introduction of fire safety codes, buildings could be built to whatever specifications the developer wanted. This often led to buildings that were built as cheaply as possible, which led to tragedies. For example, while sprinkler systems have existed since the early 1800s and the first in North America was installed in 1852, it was not mandatory to install them in new buildings. Sprinkler systems were often ignored, as installation added to the cost of construction. Many fires that could have been quelled easily with sprinkler systems instead razed buildings and led to many deaths, such as during the infamous 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Thanks to building codes that mandate safety systems such as sprinklers and fire escapes, tragedies like the Triangle fire are less common. Why EV Charging Infrastructure Building Codes Are Important In the case of EV charging infrastructure, building codes ensure safe installation, but they also help “future proof” buildings and facilitate EV adoption. When people have easy access to EV supply equipment (EVSE), they’re more ready to purchase an EV. And if you're going to charge your car, what better place to plug in than at your home or workplace where you spend most of your time? And this is where EVSE building codes come in. In a proverbial nutshell, EVSE building codes guarantee that every new commercial or multi-unit dwelling (MUD) has EV charging infrastructure. In the absence of charging stations, EV drivers sometimes plug a travel EV charging cord into an available 110V wall outlet, which can create a tripping hazard, as well as a fire hazard if the travel cord is damaged. Buildings that install charging stations to meet local code can ensure driver and pedestrian safety, as well as better manage their electrical usage. The Southwest Energy Efficiency Project (SWEEP) says EV building codes are necessary to: Meet federal, state and local EV ownership targets. Stay current with rapidly evolving EV automotive trends. Help meet the nationwide need for more EV charging infrastructure as EV adoption becomes more widespread. Expand access to EVs by providing more places for owners to charge. Save developers money by requiring upfront infrastructure rather than performing expensive retrofits later. Building codes do not require old (heritage) buildings to be retrofitted with EV charging infrastructure, but sometimes they require retrofitting more modern buildings during ongoing renovations. SWEEP has compiled an ongoing list of all the jurisdictions in the United States that have implemented building codes for mandatory EVSE in new developments. You may ask, ""Do building codes currently require EV charging?"" While EV Readiness was originally included in the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2024 when first announced, these provisions were moved upon appeals to the optional appendix. However, while IECC 2024 may not require EV infrastructure, state and local building codes may have this requirement. Three Types of Make Ready Building Codes for EV Readiness Most EVSE building codes for new developments fall into one of three categories: EV-Capable Parking Spaces EV-Ready Parking Spaces EV-Installed Parking Spaces EV-Capable Parking Spaces EV-Capable parking spaces have the wiring and conduits in place for EVSE, but do not have any actual chargers or dedicated circuits. The installation includes panel capacity and conduits (sometimes known as raceways) that would be able to accommodate installing 208/240 V, 40-amp circuits, and EV chargers. This underground work makes it easier to later add the receptacle for plugging in a charger. EV-Ready Parking Spaces An EV-Ready parking space takes things one step further. In addition to wiring and conduits, EV-Ready spaces include the installation of full circuits for 208/240V, 40-amp panel capacity, receptacles/junction boxes, and overprotection devices for the parking spaces. This would give them the same electrical capacity as the circuit for your dryer or other major appliances. These spaces are essentially “plug and play” and can immediately receive EV chargers if/when necessary. EV-Installed Parking Spaces As the name implies, EV-Installed spaces are where the EVSE is installed in the parking space. All electrical work has been completed, and the charging station is ready to charge a vehicle. Other Kinds of EVSE Building codes In addition to EV Readiness, some jurisdictions also include requirements for building operations and electricity usage. Existing Building Alterations Some jurisdictions have building codes that address existing buildings. For example, a Denver EV building code proposal suggested that existing buildings that are undergoing a Level 3 Alteration “where the work area exceeds 50 percent of the original building area or more than 10 parking spaces are substantially modified” should be required to install EVSE. The rationale is that buildings should be retrofitted with EVSE if they undergo any major alterations or modernization because their lifespan is typically around 50 years. Electric Vehicle Load Management Systems Many EV building codes include requirements for EV charging load management, which splits the available power on a circuit between multiple vehicles. With EV Local Load Management, buildings can add additional chargers to the same circuit without straining the electrical load. This helps to increase cost effectiveness by allowing a given electrical circuit to share power across multiple charging stations. View construction resources for installing Blink charging stations. EVSE Minimum Requirements It’s up to the individual jurisdictions to set their preferred minimum requirements, but cities such as Seattle, Chicago and Atlanta have all set 20% minimum requirements for EV charging. In these cities, a minimum of 20% of the parking spaces in new commercial buildings and MUDs must include some type of EVSE readiness. This requirement allows parking lots to easily accommodate a scenario where 20% of the vehicles are electric, but the use of load management would also allow a scenario with 100% EVs. “Under a 20% EV Readiness scenario, buildings would be outfitted to support additional EV drivers beyond the 20% penetration with minimal additional cost. A minimum 20% electrical capacity allows for Load Management Software to ‘share’ load and allow reasonable charge times for 100% of spaces in residential and workplace applications,” SWEEP says. Some jurisdictions with more ambitious EV adoption targets even require 100% EVSE readiness for new MUD and commercial developments! Note that buildings seeking LEED certification may receive 1 point for installing make-ready EV infrastructure under LEED v4.1. Building Retrofits As far as old, heritage buildings are concerned, retrofits are unfortunately much more expensive than new developments. Older buildings are more likely to require major renovations in the parking lot, as well as electrical system upgrades. While it’s possible to retrofit an old building with EVSE, and Blink works with many owners of existing buildings, the cost of new site work adds up. For this reason, we recommend that developers minimize future costs by installing conduits and EV ready infrastructure during other renovation projects on-site. Conclusion EVSE building codes are a helpful tool that facilitates EV adoption, ensures safety, and saves money down the road. If you are constructing a new building and you are looking to install EVSE, Blink can help you choose the best EV charging setup for your situation. Ready to get started?

What Parking Facilities Should Know About Installing EV Charging Stations | Blink Charging Blog,"What Parking Facilities Should Know About Installing EV Charging Stations Posted 06/18/2024 The world’s transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is in full swing, and those vehicles need places to charge. The great thing about EVs is that they can refuel where they park. If you own or run a parking garage or parking lot, you have the ideal location to provide refueling opportunities. Globally, EV sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, representing a 35% year-on-year increase. Clearly, now is the time for parking companies and any other entity that owns or runs a parking garage or parking lot to install EV charging equipment to: Attract more customers Increase revenue Improve driver loyalty Demonstrate leadership In this blog, we will explore how parking management companies can achieve all these goals with EV charging and consider other factors for installing EV charging infrastructure. EV charging can help you recoup lost parking revenue Parking has evolved since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before COVID, many parking garages were fully booked, making it difficult to dedicate spots for EV charging. However, COVID-19 restrictions starting in March 2020 caused a shift in personal and work travel. As NAIOP wrote, “Except for curbside pickup of retail purchases and carry-out meals, most travelers stayed home and avoided commercial and private parking lots and on-street spaces. In April 2020, passenger travel on roads declined by 60%, while public transit usage fell by 81%, and air travel slumped by 96%, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It was not until the spring of 2021 that passenger car travel returned to 2019 levels on average, but with wide variations across the country.” Since the pandemic drastically altered the working landscape, with more people working from home, metro parking garages have more available spots. This has provided opportunities for parking management companies to use some of these empty spots for dedicated EV charging, recouping some of the lost revenue. It's important to note that EV charging stations are best thought of as an amenity. While parking managers can monetize charging station parking spots, EV drivers avoid locations they feel are “too expensive.” Instead, EV charging stations can attract customers who otherwise would have parked at a competitor’s lot, and kWh or duration-based parking fees can generate additional revenue alongside your facility’s hourly parking rate. Generally, Level 2 chargers can charge a vehicle in four to eight hours, while a DCFC can charge a vehicle in under an hour. New parking facilities must install EV charging to adhere to building codes. Parking management companies want to provide the latest amenities for their customers to increase loyalty while adhering to building code requirements. How many EV chargers should a parking management company install? This largely depends on the garage's location and local EV charging building codes for new structures. Many municipalities require that a certain percentage of the parking spots in newly built structures have some form of EV readiness: EV Capable- Have the wiring and conduits pre-installed, EV Ready- Have the wiring and conduits installed and dedicated circuits set up for charging stations, EV Installed- Have EV charging stations in place and ready to use immediately. When retrofitting older parking garages, we recommend parking management companies gauge the demand for EV charging to determine how many charging stations they need. You can choose to have it all done for you. Typically, when a parking management company approaches Blink, the first step is deciding whether they want just equipment or both equipment and installation, known as a turnkey project. For turnkey projects, Blink works with an electrical contractor to perform the complete EV charging equipment setup. If it’s a turnkey project, we’ll reach out to one of our contractors to get pricing for the installation. We coordinate, arrange a site visit, and get the installation cost, then provide a full turnkey quote or refer them to the contractor to work directly. Power and/or communication upgrades may be necessary. Parking garages may require power upgrades, like an additional electrical transformer on-site, or communication upgrades, like installing a cellular booster to increase signal strength. Garage owners may also choose EV charging equipment that is WiFi or Ethernet-enabled, adding to the installation cost. Another consideration is Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. While the Access Board has not yet determined the number of accessible charging stations that must be installed at each location, at least one charging station should be ADA accessible. Additional requirements apply if a parking garage seeks Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. EV charging stations should be grouped and easy to find. Parking management companies often disperse EV charging units over multiple floors or tuck them away in hard-to-find corners. However, grouping charging stations together in a convenient, well-lit location is better for both installers and EV drivers. For example, if a parking garage requires a cellular booster, it will need only one if the charging units are grouped, rather than one for each location with a charging unit. Using wall-mounted charging units allows wiring and conduits to run along walls and ceilings, preventing the need to bore into the garage floor. You may be able to take advantage of load management. Load management allows the available power in an electrical element to be shared equally among charging stations. There are three levels of load management a parking garage may benefit from: Circuit level Panel level Site level With circuit level load management, multiple charging ports share the power load on a single circuit. In panel level load management, all available power in an electrical panel is shared. For larger installations, site level load management—where all available power at a site is used for load management—may be required. Conclusion Installing EV charging infrastructure in parking garages helps parking management companies attract more customers, increase revenue, improve driver loyalty, and demonstrate environmental and technological leadership.

Why Level 2 Electric Vehicle Chargers Are the Dominant Choice for EV Charging | Blink Charging Blog,"Why Level 2 Electric Vehicle Chargers Are the Dominant Choice for EV Charging Posted 07/21/2023 With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing need for reliable charging infrastructure, Level 2 (L2) EV chargers have emerged as the dominant choice for EV charging. While Level 3 chargers, also known as DC Fast Chargers (DCFC), grab headlines for their rapid charging capabilities, L2 chargers continue to be the main supplier as they meet the daily charging needs of EV owners. Why L2 Is the Go-To for EV Charging With the increasing number of people switching to EVs, there is a demand for reliable charging solutions. It’s estimated that more than 30 million EV chargers will be needed by 2030 to support the steady growth of EV adoption in the US. Level 2 chargers are the ultimate go-to solution because they can be installed practically everywhere. After all, Level 2 chargers use the standard 240V electrical supply, while DCFC requires 480V and additional permitting. Some businesses may already have the electrical infrastructure needed to install an L2 charger, making electrification even more cost-effective. According to the US Department of Transportation, the average driver in the US drives only 37 miles per day. Need to run errands or go shopping? Charge up while you shop! Going to the office? Charge up while you work! L2 charging is a perfect choice for property owners and managers looking to serve EV drivers without the expense of installing DCFCs. In 2022, the US had over 136,500 public electric vehicle chargers, strategically distributed across nearly 53,800 charging locations. It's worth noting that over 75% of these chargers are categorized as L2 chargers. The growth of public chargers has been consistently on the rise since 2007, supporting the expansion and adoption of electric vehicles nationwide. Blink has helped make American-made L2 chargers widely available, whether in public locations or at home. They have become an integral part of our daily routine, ensuring that EVs stay fully powered and ready to go. The best part? These Blink chargers are made in America, supporting American jobs, income, and growth. L2 Chargers Save You Money We all know that EVs are better for the environment and an investment for the future, but what effect does EV charging have on our finances? Unlike DCFCs, L2 chargers can make use of existing electrical systems in homes and businesses, with less extensive upgrades. In one International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) study on installation costs, the average cost of installing a single networked L2 charger was $2,836. Installation costs immediately increased for DCFC, with average installation costs of $45,506 for a 50kW unit, and $65,984 for a 350kW. These costs do not include the cost of the charging stations themselves, which averaged $3,127 for a networked L2, $28,401 for a 50kW DCFC, and $140,000 for a 350kW DCFC. L2 chargers are truly the more affordable choice. This optimized energy flow not only maximizes charging efficiency but also minimizes wastage, resulting in significant cost savings for the home or business. Compared to lower-level options (such as a basic Level 1 power cable), L2 stations offer a superior overnight charging experience to make electric vehicle ownership more affordable while contributing to a sustainable electric mobility ecosystem. EV Chargers at Home Picture this: It's nighttime, and you've had a long day. Your EV is in need of a recharge. That's where L2 home chargers come in. Residential L2 chargers like Blink’s HQ 200 are designed to make charging from the comfort of your home easier and more accessible. These chargers can be hardwired into your home electrical system or plugged into your standard NEMA 14-50 outlet. The Blink HQ 200 is perfect for overnight charging at home, especially when you can take advantage of off-peak utility rates when electricity is cheaper. By using a L2 charger, you can conveniently recharge your EV overnight while minimizing your effect on your monthly utility bill and local energy grid. It's a win-win situation for you and the environment. According to J.D. Power’s U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience (EVX) Home Charging Study, an overwhelming 88% of electric vehicle (EV) owners reported charging their vehicles at home either “often” or “always,” making the market for EV home-based chargers innovative and competitive. What if you don’t live in a single-family house? No problem. L2 chargers have gained popularity among multi-unit properties due to their exceptional features. Blink's Series 7 charging stations are specially designed to cater to fleet and multi-unit properties, offering L2 AC chargers with an impressive power output of up to 80 amps. Equipped with a dual-port design and Universal J1772 plugs, these charging stations enable two vehicles to charge simultaneously. The convenience they provide is unparalleled, making them an important component of the electric vehicle industry. What Else Can L2 Chargers Do? As the demand for EV charging infrastructure skyrockets, L2 chargers play a crucial role in supporting the rapid growth of the national EV charging network. These chargers require less infrastructure investment, enabling their deployment to be both faster and more cost-effective. Leveraging this forward-thinking initiative, Blink has successfully deployed thousands of L2 chargers across the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East as a leading provider of L2 EV chargers. This extensive deployment allows Blink to establish a widespread charging network, ensuring convenient access to charging options ranging from residential areas to workplaces and public spaces. While DCFCs may capture attention with their impressive fast charging abilities, L2 chargers remain the preferred option for daily charging. Their availability, cost-effectiveness, suitability for overnight charging, and contribution to the growth of charging infrastructure establish them as the dependable and convenient choice for EV owners. As the electric vehicle market continues to grow, L2 chargers will maintain their position as the primary choice for everyday EV consumers.
