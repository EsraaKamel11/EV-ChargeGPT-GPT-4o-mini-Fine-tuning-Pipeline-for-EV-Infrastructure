Our Focus on Additionality Electrify America Solar Glow 1: Our First Solar Farm With over 200,000 solar panels, our first solar farm in Southern California generates an estimated 75 megawatts at peak capacity and produced 225 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy in its first year. This is an important milestone in our commitment to reduce our energy carbon footprint, improve efficiency, and elevate the customer experience. LEARN MORE Types of Solar Charging Stations and Features 100 Solar-Powered Level 2 Stations Electrify America has invested 2 million in 30 solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across rural California. These resilient Level 2 (L2) stations arent tied to the electrical grid, and they provide drivers in rural areas access to EV charging via renewable resources. Equipped with a sun-tracking solar array and energy storage, each station can charge two vehicles simultaneously, rain or shine. Capable vehicles can charge at speeds up to 3.5 kW. On-Site Solar Canopies Stay cool while you charge at locations like our Baker, California station, where solar canopies provide shade and deliver energy back to the grid. These charging stations integrate with the local electrical grid and some even feature on-site energy storage, delivering efficient, reliable charging. Building a Grid-Friendly Charging Network Charging multiple EVs at the same station requires lots of power. To ease electrical grid demand during peak use times, weve installed 150 Battery Energy S",

    "cleaned_text": "How to Answer Top EV FAQs This Season at Your Dealership Posted 05092023 Its a new car-buying season and many new car buyers want to take advantage of the federal governments electric vehicle tax incentives. With many customers considering their first EV, its up to the dealership sales representatives to answer questions and address knowledge gaps about this new technology. To help, we have compiled some of the most common frequently asked questions asked by dealership customers and new EV owners before buying their first EV. What is the difference between Level 1, Level 2, and Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) stations? Before we begin, it should be noted that the term charger is a bit unique when talking about EVs. Each EV comes with an on-board charger inside the vehicle. Level 1 and Level 2 charging stations simply provide alternating current (AC) electricity to the vehicles on-board charger, which then converts AC to direct current (DC) electricity and charges the battery. The on-board charger is different from an external EV charging station, also referred to as EV Supply Equipment or EVSE. In most cases, the word charger refers to a charging station or cable that delivers power to the vehicle. Level 1 chargers These are the charging cables that come with most EVs. They are small enough to carry in a vehicle truck and plug into a regular 120 volt wall outlet. Generally speaking, they will take 12 hours to fully charge an EV. (It could be several dozen hours if they are charging a battery from empty.) Level 2 chargers These are the next step up in charging equipment. For a faster home charging experience, EV drivers can purchase Level 2 chargers such as the Blink HQ 150 or HQ 200. In addition, most commercial public, multi-unit, and workplace charging stations will be Level 2 chargers. Depending on the model, Level 2 charging stations provide up to 80amp to fully charge an EV in 4-8 hours, though some vehicles may take longer. Level 2 chargers can",

The electric vehicle (EV) industry has not only experienced exponential growth in the past decade but has also yielded remarkable economic benefits. Giving rise to an entire culture, EVs have surpassed mere trends and evolved into a comprehensive lifestyle that prioritizes a sustainable future. Whether youre an experienced EV enthusiast or new to the scene, a multitude of innovative EV solutions awaits your exploration. While there is a world of advantages, here are three reasons why EVs are here to stay. Cut Costs, Time, and Effort with EVs Cost competitiveness, heightened convenience, and streamlined maintenance, accompanied by amplified fuel savings these are the undeniable benefits awaiting those who make the decision to invest in EVs. EVs Help You Save Many people ask whether electric cars are worth it due to the upfront expense. However, when you factor in federal tax incentives, electric cars actually end up costing about the same as regular cars. And heres the cool part: electric cars need less maintenance and are cheaper to power, so you save money over the life of the vehicle. Government policies are giving a big boost to EV adoption. The Inflation Reduction Act expanded the previous EV tax credit to lower costs for qualified buyers. These credits offer up to 7,500 for new vehicles, up to 4,000 for used EVs, and even up to 30 for commercial vehicles and buses. And the good news doesnt stop there the support for EV charging infrastructure at businesses will continue until 2032, with the maximum tax credit raised from 30,000 to 100,000. This all adds up to more electric vehicles on the road, more savings for drivers, and a healthier environment. But its not just about initial costs. Electric cars also save you money on fuel. EV drivers have the potential to reduce fuel expenses by up to 14,500 over a 15-year period of owni",

Every owner or investor strives to maximize their profit or return on investment for their properties. Fortunately, theres a relatively simple way to help increase the money coming into your multifamily or workplace investment property: install electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Heres what you need to know. How EVSE makes your investment property better Electric vehicle (EV) chargers are an amenity that instantly raises the value of any multifamily, residential, or commercial property. According to a study published in Nature Sustainability last year, single-family homes located within one kilometer (0.6 miles) of public EV charging infrastructure experienced a 3.3 (or US 17,212) rise in property value compared to homes without nearby chargers. Homes with EV chargers within 400 to 500 meters (437 to 547 yards) saw an even higher increase of 5.8 in property value. Additionally, the study revealed that neighborhoods with public EV chargers also experienced lower levels of particulate matter emissions by 1.3 2.2 compared to those without any chargers. While the Nature Sustainability study focused on single-family homes, its evident that EVSE has a positive impact both economically and environmentally for properties. Preparing your investment for future needs While having EVSE at home or work is still currently considered a luxury, within the next decade, it will essentially become mandatory. Many municipalities are already incorporating EV charger installation requirements into their building codes to ensure that new buildings are equipped for the increasing number of EV drivers. Installing EVSE in your multifamily community enables you to cater to families who either already own an EV or are planning to purchase one soon. It also helps at",

The corporate value chain links companies together, and if a company wants to truly reduce its carbon footprint, that means it must consider not only its own direct greenhouse gas emissions, but also how to reduce the emissions from its upstream and downstream positions. Transitioning corporate vehicle fleets from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) is a concrete step toward reducing emissions and helping every company in a given value chain, along with providing EV charging for your employees. Heres what you need to know about how to use EV charging to reduce your companys direct and indirect emissions. What Are the Three Types of Greenhouse Gas Emission Sources? The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol has identified three different categories of corporate greenhouse gas emissions throughout the value chain. With the Scope 3 Standard, companies can now measure and report upstream and downstream emissions, not just those directly controlled by corporate activities. This standard allows improves transparency and allows companies to develop more effective strategies for emissions reductions. Here is how the GHG Protocol describes the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Scope 1 Emissions Scope 1 emissions are generated by operations that are directly owned or controlled by the company. These emissions might include company-owned equipment or company-owned fleet vehicles. Scope 2 Emissions Scope 2 emissions include upstream emissions from generating electricity bought by the company. An example would be if a company uses electricity from a coal-burning power plant. The company would be indirectly responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions produced from the power it uses. Scope 3 Emissions Sc",

The buildings we inhabit, and their parking lots, are evolving too. More and more municipalities are adopting new building codes that mandate electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in new developments, further facilitating the overall adoption of EVs. Heres what you need to know about EV building codes, also known as EV Make Ready infrastructure. Why building codes are important Building codes are important for standardizing building quality and safety. For example, before the introduction of fire safety codes, buildings could be built to whatever specifications the developer wanted. This often led to buildings that were built as cheaply as possible, which led to tragedies. For example, while sprinkler systems have existed since the early 1800s and the first in North America was installed in 1852, it was not mandatory to install them in new buildings. Sprinkler systems were often ignored, as installation added to the cost of construction. Many fires that could have been quelled easily with sprinkler systems instead razed buildings and led to many deaths, such as during the infamous 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Thanks to building codes that mandate safety systems such as sprinklers and fire escapes, tragedies like the Triangle fire are less common. Why EV Charging Infrastructure Building Codes Are Important In the case of EV charging infrastructure, building codes ensure safe installation, but they also help future proof buildings and facilitate EV adoption. When people have easy access to EV supply equipment (EVSE), theyre more ready to purchase an EV. And if youre going to charge your car, what better place to plug in than at your home or workplace where you spend most of your time? And this is where EVSE building codes come in.

The great thing about EVs is that they can refuel where they park. If you own or run a parking garage or parking lot, you have the ideal location to provide refueling opportunities. Globally, EV sales in 2023 were 3.5 million higher than in 2022, representing a 35 year-on-year increase. Clearly, now is the time for parking companies and any other entity that owns or runs a parking garage or parking lot to install EV charging equipment to: Attract more customers Increase revenue Improve driver loyalty Demonstrate leadership In this blog, we will explore how parking management companies can achieve all these goals with EV charging and consider other factors for installing EV charging infrastructure. EV charging can help you recoup lost parking revenue Parking has evolved since the COVID-19 pandemic. Before COVID, many parking garages were fully booked, making it difficult to dedicate spots for EV charging. However, COVID-19 restrictions starting in March 2020 caused a shift in personal and work travel. As NAIOP wrote, Except for curbside pickup of retail purchases and carry-out meals, most travelers stayed home and avoided commercial and private parking lots and on-street spaces. In April 2020, passenger travel on roads declined by 60, while public transit usage fell by 81, and air travel slumped by 96, according to the U.S. Department of Transportations Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It was not until the spring of 2021 that passenger car travel returned to 2019 levels on average, but with wide variations across the country. Since the pandemic drastically altered the working landscape, with more people working from home, metro parking garages have more available spots. This has provided opportunities for parking management companies to use some of these emp",

    "cleaned_text": "Why Level 2 Electric Vehicle Chargers Are the Dominant Choice for EV Charging Posted 07212023 With the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing need for reliable charging infrastructure, Level 2 (L2) EV chargers have emerged as the dominant choice for EV charging. While Level 3 chargers, also known as DC Fast Chargers (DCFC), grab headlines for their rapid charging capabilities, L2 chargers continue to be the main supplier as they meet the daily charging needs of EV owners. Why L2 Is the Go-To for EV Charging With the increasing number of people switching to EVs, there is a demand for reliable charging solutions. Its estimated that more than 30 million EV chargers will be needed by 2030 to support the steady growth of EV adoption in the US. Level 2 chargers are the ultimate go-to solution because they can be installed practically everywhere. After all, Level 2 chargers use the standard 240V electrical supply, while DCFC requires 480V and additional permitting. Some businesses may already have the electrical infrastructure needed to install an L2 charger, making electrification even more cost-effective. According to the US Department of Transportation, the average driver in the US drives only 37 miles per day. Need to run errands or go shopping? Charge up while you shop! Going to the office? Charge up while you work! L2 charging is a perfect choice for property owners and managers looking to serve EV drivers without the expense of installing DCFCs. In 2022, the US had over 136,500 public electric vehicle chargers, strategically distributed across nearly 53,800 charging locations. Its worth noting that over 75 of these chargers are categorized as L2 chargers. The growth of public chargers has been consistently on the rise since 2007, supporting the expansion and adoption of electric vehicles nationwide. Blink has helped make American-made L2 chargers widely available, whether in public locations or at home. They have become an integral par",
